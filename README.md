## How to Start a TV Show on YouTube

If you’re looking for a specific TV show on YouTube TV, you’ll start at the home screen, which is the screen that comes up when you launch YouTube TV. Scroll right to the magnifying glass and select it. This will allow you to type in the title of the show you’re looking for. 

From there, if it’s available on YouTube TV’s show list, you’ll be able to select it and play any available seasons and episodes.

## How to Start a Live Show From the Beginning on YouTube TV

One feature that YouTube TV provides is the option to start live TV shows from the beginning. In some cases, the show must already be in your library of shows to start it from the beginning. Selecting the plus sign (+) next to a show will add it to your library. Once it’s added, all upcoming episodes will be recorded and you will be able to watch them anytime, whether they’re live or not. 

Since YouTube TV offers unlimited storage space, you can save as many shows as you’d like. When you select a show that’s playing live and it’s available to start for the beginning, just select that “start from beginning” option on the play screen.
